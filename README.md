# Embedded Programming Tutorial

The purpose of this git repository is to provide a short, non-exhaustive tutorial covering certain embedded programming concepts in 3 exercises.

The first exercise focuses on programming in C, compilers and makefiles. In particular, it aims to help you understand how a compiler works, what tools are available to analyse compiler output, and the concept of makefiles.

The second exercise focuses on bare metal programming through a small use case using the LM75 sensor. The idea is to introduce the notion of device driver, how to set IO parameters and interrupts.
